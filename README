Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. 
An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. 
Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods. 
The main idea here is to reduce the amount of code since abstract class allows you define a basic functionality leaving undefined parts. 

The dimensions for all shapes is shown using a single statement whereas the area and perimeter is calculated separately for different shapes. Abstraction plays a major role in this context.
